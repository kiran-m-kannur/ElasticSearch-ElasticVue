# ElasticSearch-ElasticVue
This is an experimental prototype that initiates a flask server between Elastic Search and ElasticVue with a flask server as reverse proxy in between 
V1 is a simple elastic-search elasticvue set up
        Run  the docker-compose file in the V1 file and then go to localhost:8080 to access your elastic search with elasticvue.

v2 is next version of v1,where a flask server which acts as a reverse proxy has been added.
        Same step as v1.
